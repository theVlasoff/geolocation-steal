# geolocation-steal
Disclaimer: This is a small .html file, which requests geolocation and later on sends the information to my email through the specific service. Was never used to hurt anybody. I know that according to the law it forbiden to steal and personally use sensitive information. 

The idea of the following code was to obtain the exact location of "MY" personal computer/phone.
 
When browser processes the page, a small javascript code requests the geolocation access. Later on, coordinates are sent to the email using _formspree_ service. 

Note: formspree is used for the testing purposes, since this index.html does not have any domain and not connected to the WWW. Otherwise, it might be easier, just to store the location in db or send it through alternative services without User even knowing that something is sent.
